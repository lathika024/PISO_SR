# PISO_SR
# The shift register, which allows parallel input (data is given separately to each flip flop and in a simultaneous manner) and produces a serial output is known as a Parallel-In Serial-Out shift register. The logic circuit given below shows a parallel-in-serial-out shift register. The circuit consists of four D flip-flops which are connected. The clock input is directly connected to all the flip-flops but the input data is connected individually to each flip-flop through a multiplexer at the input of every flip-flop. The output of the previous flip-flop and parallel data input are connected to the input of the MUX and the output of MUX is connected to the next flip-flop. All these flip-flops are synchronous with each other since the same clock signal is applied to each flip-flop. 
# AIM: 
To simulate and synthesis  PISO_SR using vivado. 
# APPARATUS REQUIRED: 
vivado 2023.2 software. 
# PROCEDURE: 
STEP:1 Start the vivado software, Select and Name the New project. 
STEP:2 Select the device family, device, package and speed. 
STEP:3 Select new source in the New Project and select Verilog Module as the 
Source type. 
STEP:4 Type the File Name and module name and Click Next and then finish 
button. Type the code and save it. 
STEP:5 Select the run simulation and then run Behavioral Simulation in the 
Source Window and click the check syntax. 
STEP:6 Click the simulation to simulate the program and give the inputs and 
verify the outputs as per the truth table. 
STEP:7 compare the output with truth table.
